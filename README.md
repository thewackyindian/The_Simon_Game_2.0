# The_Simon_Game_2.0

## Description
Another basic but worthy to look upon a HTML , CSS and JS version of 1978 Simon Game.

The web-page creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails , the game is over. 

### Upcoming-features:
Leaderboard , Two or More Player Game , Simon automatically Speed up ,RAZZ sound and more....

### Happy Playing!
