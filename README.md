# The_Simon_Game_2.0
Another basic but worthy to look upon a HTML , CSS and JS version of 1978 Simon Game.  The page creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails , the game is over.
